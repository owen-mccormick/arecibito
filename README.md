### Arecibito (yet another tiny radio telescope)

This repo contains OpenSCAD designs, Arduino and Raspberry Pi code for my build of a "tiny radio telescope" capable of imaging TV satellites in the sky. For a fuller explanation, please see the versions built by [Gon√ßalo Nespral](https://hackaday.io/project/161556-tiny-radio-telescope) and [The Thought Emporium](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeah3fFYlnA).

This repo contains OpenSCAD designs, Arduino and Raspberry Pi code for my build of a "tiny radio telescope" - for a fuller explanation of how this works, please see the versions that inspired this project built by [Gon√ßalo Nespral](https://hackaday.io/project/161556-tiny-radio-telescope/details) and [The Thought Emporium](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeah3fFYlnA).
